<p align="center">
SoundBounds is a region-based soundtracking mod for Minecraft. It blocks
all vanilla in-game music, and allows the user to define complex and
nested regions, each with their own customizable playlist.
</p>

## Features

- Smooth, two-second fade when exiting a region
- Compound region support (regions with multiple bounding boxes)
- Dimension-specific regions
- Volume control using vanilla options screen
- Swappable resource packs to supply assets
- Command for checking current-playing song (`/sb now-playing`)
- Fully-featured command-line interface allows users to manipulate and
    query regions, playlists and songs
- Built within Minecraft's own OpenAL context to provide maximum
    possible compatibility
- Playlists can be shuffled or sequential
- Songs can be non-looping, 1-part loops, or loops with a non-looping
    intro
